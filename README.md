# PhapDien website semantic search

This is the repository for crawling the **PhapDien website**, creating a vector database with ChromaDB and doing a semantic search on the vector database. The main notebooks (for web scraping and testing) are `scrapebook.ipynb`, `vector_create.ipynb`, `semantic_search.ipynb`. The demo script is `gradio_demo.py`, and the embedding script (for vector_db generation on Hugging Face) is `vector_embedding.py`.
